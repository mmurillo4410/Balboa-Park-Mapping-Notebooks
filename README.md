# We can put links to notebooks here and post any code or questions 

Later we can take the good info and add it to the ReadMe for the project: 

1. Viewshed Analysis 

Relevance: This method of analysis identifies all possible viewpoints from a specific location in the project area. Below is the link to the ArcGIS Interactive Viewshed demonstration and how to apply to our project area.

[ArcGIS Interactive Viewshed Directions/Application](https://doc.arcgis.com/en/arcgis-earth/use/interactive-analysis.htm#:~:text=Viewshed%20analysis%20indicates%20the%20visibility%20%28visible%20or%20obstructed%29,in%20the%20scene%20to%20specify%20the%20observer%20position.)

## Economic Analysis 

Relevance: This method will take the 1989 Master Plan and overlay it with the most up-to-date map we have in order to assess the economic standing of the neighborhood and how the creation of the park has effected the surrounding community. 

## Isochrone Analysis

Relevance: This method will examine the park's accessibility through public transportation. In order to increase the utilization of the park by local communities it needs to be accessible. If the new plan intends on removing parking spaces, park utilization will decline of accessibilty is low. 

## Slope Analysis 

Relevance: Specifically requested by SAGE, this method will help determine the future development of the park. In coordination with the viewshed analysis, slope analysis will allow developers to discover what areas are accessible through walking, biking, or cars. Thus slope analysis can give insight on what time of development can occur throughout the park.
